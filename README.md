- **📄 Progressive File Assembly**: Section-by-section generation with quality safeguards
- **⚡ Parallel Search Execution**: 5-10 concurrent searches + parallel agents (3-5x faster Phase 3)
- **🎯 First Finish Search (FFS) Pattern**: Adaptive completion based on quality thresholds
- **🔍 Enhanced Citation Validation (CiteGuard)**: Hallucination detection, URL verification, multi-source cross-checking
- **📋 Dynamic Outline Evolution (WebWeaver)**: Adapt structure after Phase 4 based on evidence
- **🔗 Attribution Gradients UI**: Interactive citation tooltips showing evidence chains in HTML reports
- **🛡️ Anti-Fatigue Enforcement**: Prose-first quality checks prevent bullet-point degradation
- **🔧 OSS Implementation Search**: Conditional search for open-source solutions — analyzes real repo architectures, adoption, and trade-offs when topics are implementation-focused

### Traditional Strengths

### Unlimited Report Generation (2025 Auto-Continuation System)

Reports use **progressive file assembly with auto-continuation** - achieving truly unlimited length through recursive agent spawning:

**How It Works:**

1. **Initial Generation (18K words)**
   - Generate sections 1-10 progressively
   - Each section written to file immediately (stays under 32K limit per agent)
   - Save continuation state with research context

2. **Auto-Continuation (if needed)**
   - Automatically spawns continuation agent via Task tool
   - Continuation agent loads state: themes, narrative arc, citations, quality metrics
   - Generates next batch of sections (another 18K words)
   - Updates state and spawns next agent if more sections remain

3. **Recursive Chaining**
   - Each agent stays under 32K output token limit
   - Chain continues until all sections complete
   - Final agent generates bibliography and validates report

**Realistic Report Sizes:**
- **Quick mode**: 2,000-4,000 words (single run) ✅
- **Standard mode**: 4,000-8,000 words (single run) ✅
- **Deep mode**: 8,000-15,000 words (single run) ✅
- **UltraDeep mode**: 20,000-100,000+ words (auto-continuation) ✅

**Example: 50,000 word report:**
- Agent 1: Sections 1-10 (18K words) → Spawns Agent 2
- Agent 2: Sections 11-20 (18K words) → Spawns Agent 3
- Agent 3: Sections 21-25 + Bibliography (14K words) → Complete!
- Total: 50K words across 3 agents, each under 32K limit

**Context Preservation (Quality Safeguards):**

Continuation state includes:
- ✅ Research question and key themes
- ✅ Main findings summaries (100 words each)
- ✅ Narrative arc position (beginning/middle/end)
- ✅ Quality metrics (avg words, citation density, prose ratio)
- ✅ All citations used + bibliography entries
- ✅ Writing style characteristics

Each continuation agent:
- Reads last 3 sections to understand flow
- Maintains established themes and style
- Continues citation numbering correctly
- Matches quality metrics (±20% tolerance)
- Verifies coherence before each section

**Quality Gates (Per Section):**
- [ ] Word count: Within ±20% of average
- [ ] Citation density: Matches established rate
- [ ] Prose ratio: ≥80% prose (not bullets)
- [ ] Theme alignment: Ties to key themes
- [ ] Style consistency: Matches established patterns

**Benefits:**
- ✅ TRUE unlimited length (50K, 100K+ words achievable)
- ✅ Fully automatic (no manual intervention)
- ✅ Context preserved across continuations
- ✅ Quality maintained throughout
- ✅ Each agent stays under 32K token limit
- ✅ Progressive assembly prevents truncation

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Specific**: Frame questions clearly with context
2. **Set Expectations**: Specify if you need comparisons, recommendations, or pure analysis
3. **Choose Appropriate Mode**: Use Quick for exploration, Deep for decisions
4. **Review Scope**: Check Phase 1 output to ensure research is on track
5. **Leverage Citations**: Use citation numbers to drill deeper into specific sources
